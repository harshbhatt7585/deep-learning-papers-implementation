ZFNet is a convolutional neural network architecture for image recognition that was introduced in 2013. It consists of five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers, with a total of 60 million parameters. ZFNet was trained on the ImageNet dataset and achieved state-of-the-art performance at the time. The architecture includes several novel features, such as smaller filter sizes in the first convolutional layer to capture fine details, and increased stride size in the last convolutional layer to reduce the spatial dimensionality of the output. ZFNet helped to establish the importance of deep convolutional neural networks for image recognition tasks.
