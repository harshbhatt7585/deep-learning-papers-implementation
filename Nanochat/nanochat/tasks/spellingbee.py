"""
Task intended to make nanochat better in spelling and counting, for example:

"How many r are in strawberry?" -> 3

An interesting part of this task is that we will get the assistant to
solve the problem using a combination of manual counting and Python.
This is a good problem solving "instinct" to mix into the model and RL
may further refine it to trust one over the other. If we were extra fancy
(which we could/should be) we'd add small errors here and there to allow
the model also learn recoveries. We can do this in future versions.

There are two tasks in this file:
1. SpellingBee: Counting the number of occurrences of a letter in a word
2. SimpleSpelling: Simply spelling words

(1) is the goal, but (2) exists as a highly condensed version of the part
that makes (1) difficult, which is word spelling. This is non-trivial for an
LLM because it has to learn how every token (a little semantic chunk/atom)
maps to the sequence of individual characters that make it up. Larger models
learn this eventually on their own, but if we want this capability to exist
in smaller models, we have to actively encourage it by over-representing it
in the training data. SFT is a good place to do this.
